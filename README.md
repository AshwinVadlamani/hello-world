# hello-world
This is my first ever github project.
TMy name is Aswhin Vadlamani and I am a 4th Year THeoretical Physics Student. My physics interests are around experiment simulations in fields on particle physics, oscillating systems and dampening, and material physics for semiconductor device development.
